1356 - SORT INTEGERS BY THE NUMBER OF 1 BITS
EASY

TEXT

You are giving an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by
the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have
the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.

FUNCTION

int* sortByBits(int* arr, int arrSize, int* returnSize);

EXAMPLE INPUT

arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

arr = [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7]

CONSTRAINTS

(1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 500)
(0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4)
