1 - TWO SUM
EASY

TEXT

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers
such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the
same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

FUNCTION

int* twoSum(int* nums, int numsSize, int target, int* returnSize);

EXAMPLE INPUT

The first number will be the numsSize. The second number will be the target.

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

[0, 1]

CONSTRAINTS

(2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^4)
(-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9)
(-10~9 ≤ target ≤ 10^9)
